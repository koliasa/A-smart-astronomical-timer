The Smart Astronomical Timer is a device designed to automatically control outdoor lighting based on astronomical data. It uses an ESP8266 microcontroller and a real-time clock module to accurately determine the sunrise and sunset times, and then turns on or off the connected lights accordingly.

The device has a built-in web interface for manual configuration of time parameters, time zone, and manual switching of the lights. It also has a special mode for weekends, which can be set to different operating hours compared to weekdays.

In addition, the timer has a feature that allows it to automatically adjust for daylight saving time changes, as well as the option to use an external light sensor to detect ambient light levels and adjust the lighting accordingly.

Overall, the Smart Astronomical Timer is an energy-efficient and convenient solution for outdoor lighting control, ideal for homes, gardens, and public spaces.
